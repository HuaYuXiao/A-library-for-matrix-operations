# A-library-for-matrix-operations
SUSTech CS205

Design a struct for matrices, and the struct should contain the data of a matrix, the number
of columns, the number of rows, etc.

## Requirements
1. Only float elements in a matrix are supported. You do not need to implement some other
types.
2. Implement some functions to
- create a matrix, createMatrix()
- delete a matrix, deleteMatrix().
- copy a matrix (copy the data from a matrix to another), copyMatrix().
- add two matrices, addMatrix().
- subtraction of two matrices, subtractMatrix()
- add a scalar to a matrix.
- subtract a scalar from a matrix.
- multiply a matrix with a scalar.
- multiply two matrices.
- find the minimal and maximal values of a matrix.
- some other functions needed
3. The designed functions should be safe and easy to use. Suppose you are designing a library for
others to use. You do not need to focus on the optimization in this project, ease of use is more
important.
